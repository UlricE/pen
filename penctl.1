.TH PENCTL 1 LOCAL

.SH NAME
penctl

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B penctl
host:port|/path/to/socket command

.SH EXAMPLE
penctl lbhost:8888 roundrobin

Turns off client tracking on the load balancer running on lbhost.

penctl /var/run/pen/tmp/ctrl status

Prints status information in html format.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Penctl
connects to the optional control socket on a pen load balancer.
It reads commands from the command line, performs minimal syntax
checking and sends them to pen. Replies, if any, are printed on stdout.

The program can also be used through the cgi script penctl.cgi,
which allows pen to be controlled from any web browser.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fIhost:port\fR
Specifies a control port where the load balancer listens for commands.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fIabort_on_error\fR
Call abort() when a fatal error is encountered. This will create a core file which allows further troubleshooting. Disabled by default.
.TP
\fIno abort_on_error\fR
Exit normally on fatal error with an error code which indicates failure.
.TP
\fIacl N permit|deny sourceip4 [mask]\fR
Adds an entry to access list N, where N is a number from 0 to 9. The source and mask addresses are in the usual dotted quad notation. If mask is omitted, it defaults to 255.255.255.255.

.TP
\fIacl N permit|deny sourceip6[/length]\fR
If the source address contains the character ':', the address is interpreted as
IPv6. Unlike IPv4 access entries, a length is used to indicate the mask. If
length is omitted, it defaults to 128.

.TP
\fIacl N permit|deny country NN\fR
If the source address is the special word "country", a two-letter country
code can be used to restrict access to the load balancer. For this to work,
pen must be built with geoip support.
.TP
\fIno acl N\fR
Deletes all entries from access list N. The resulting access list
permits all traffic.
.TP
\fIascii\fR
Communication dumps in ascii format (cf option -a).

Communication dumps in hex format.
.TP
\fIblacklist\fR
Return current blacklist time in seconds.

Return current debug level.
.TP
\fIdebug N\fR
